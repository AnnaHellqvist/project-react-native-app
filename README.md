# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

### Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
The purpose of this project was to create a mobile app with React Native. I choosed to create a multipage game app with React Navigation. The app is a tribute to Sheldon in the tv series big bang theory and his own version of "rock, paper, scissors". 

## The problem

I started creating the three different screens of my app, Start, UserPick and Result. Then I added navigation and buttons on every screen and made sure I could navigate through the pages and back to the start page.
I used three states in the UserPickScreen component to set what the user picks and what the computer picks (randomized).
Using route to pass the state values as props to the ResultScreen. 
I added a conditional statement to compare the user and computer input to show who won. 

If I had more time I would have made the button disabled or hidden it if the user hasn't clicked and choosen an alternative. Now I solved it with a text in the result page telling the user to play again. I would also have added a global styling file and reused my styled components in the different screens.
